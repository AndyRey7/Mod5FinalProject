# WanderLust - A place for travel bugs

## Author

 A website where the user can select from a list of hotels available and choose what kind of room to book from that hotel. Then they can view their profile to edit or delete their reservations. Also, they can look for places to eat around where they are staying. All of these feature are provided only if a user is logged in or they can sign-up. Enjoy!

## Setup

To get you going, I've got a backend with hotels waiting to be booked!  To get get these guys, you're going to have to do the follow:

1. In your terminal run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies.
2. Navigate to `backend-mod-5-proj` and run `rails s` from your terminal to get the backend up and running.
3. Navigate to `wander-lust` and run npm start or yarn start to get the front-end working

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
